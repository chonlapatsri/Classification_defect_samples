# Classification_samples
Jupyter notebooks of redacted code to build classification models with classical machine learning algorithms and Deep Learning Neural Networks with Tensorflow.

There are three Jupyter notebooks containing a model to solve the same problem
1. Two-level binary classification model using the classical Machine Learning algorithms and ensemble model (mostly Scikit-learn + CatBoost)
2. Two-level binary classification model using Deep Learning Neural Network (Tensorflow Keras)
3. Single-level multiclass model using Deep Learning Neural Network (Tensorflow Keras)

Hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, oversampling, and early stopping were used in the creation of each/some models
