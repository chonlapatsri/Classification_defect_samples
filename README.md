# Classification_defect_samples
Jupyter notebooks of redacted code to build classification models.

The performance does not represent the actual performance of the full version model for the actual problems.
A randomly generated dataset was used to replace the real dataset
It will be replaced the IRIS problem when there is time to do so.

There are three Jupyter notebooks containing a model to solve the same problem
1. Two-level binary classification model using the classical Machine Learning algorithms and ensemble model (mostly Scikit-learn + CatBoost)
2. Two-level binary classification model using Deep Learning Neural Network (Tensorflow Keras)
3. Single-level multiclass model using Deep Learning Neural Network (Tensorflow Keras)

Hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, oversampling, and early stopping were used in the creation of each/some models
